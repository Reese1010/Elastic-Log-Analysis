# SOC Analyst Project: Endpoint Detection - Login Analysis
This project demonstrates the use of Elastic Search and Kibana to analyze login activity data and detect signs of credential misuse within an enterprise environment

# Objectives
* Detect unauthorized use of the vulscan login
* Identify potentially compromised endpoints
* Determine possible source machines used in the attack

# Overview
An attacker has performed a successful attack and obtained the credential of the vulnerability scanner. Find compromised machines by analyzing login activities of the vulnerability scanner

# Tools & Technology
* Elastic
* Kibana
* Log file (svclog) â€“ Contains login event data

# Analysis Workflow
* Log Ingestion: Imported the svclog file into Elastic Cloud for investigation
* Kibana Querying: Built targeted queries to isolate logins by the vulscan account
* Behavioral Analysis: Reviewed timestamps, source IPs, and workstation names to identify unusual login patterns
* Compromised Endpoint Identification:  Pinpointed machines that were accessed using the stolen vulscan credentials outside of normal scanner behavior
